_The application includes in the `frontend` folder a basic application programmed with React to access the REST API programmed with NodeJS and Express in the backend that accesses a mongoDB database. In the `build` folder is included the precompiled React frontend for deploy along with the backend._

## Deploy

The deploy was done in [render.com](https://render.com) and the live page is [here](https://fullstackopen-part3-ajna.onrender.com/)

The JSON responses from the backend API (`api/persons`, `api/persons/<id>`) can be accessed [here](https://fullstackopen-part3-ajna.onrender.com/api/persons)

For the mongoDB database in the cloud, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) has been used.
